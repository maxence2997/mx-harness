# mx-flow

## Trigger

```
/mx-flow <topic>          ← full pipeline: idea to PR
/mx-flow finish <name>    ← post-merge cleanup (read references/finish.md and follow it)
```

## Non-negotiables

Violating any of these is a workflow failure. They bind every phase and
every sub-agent this skill dispatches.

1. **Worktree before any code edit** — before making any code change,
   verify the working directory is a git worktree
   (`git rev-parse --git-dir` contains `worktrees/`). If not, STOP and run
   Phase 4 first.
2. **Iron Law — no production code without a failing test first.** Code
   written before its test exists must be deleted and reimplemented after
   the test is in place. No exceptions.
3. **Never weaken a gate to get green** — no `--no-verify`, no lint
   suppressions to silence a finding, no deleting/skipping a failing test,
   no rewriting a RED test to match broken behavior, no relaxed assertions,
   no widened timeouts. A gate fighting you is a design signal: apply the
   wrong-direction rubric (doctrine below) — change approach or ask.
4. **Review before verify** — do not enter Phase 6 unless mx-team-review
   and mx-review-triage have run on the current branch diff at least once
   in this session. If unsure, check for a review report in
   `.mx/<name>/tmp/`.
5. **Retry budget** — the same task failing verification twice (regardless
   of approach) → stop retrying. In a harness with sub-agents, escalate to
   the strongest tier with the full failure trail (what was tried, exact
   diffs, exact errors); otherwise present that trail to the user with
   concrete options. Never a third identical attempt. (Small-tier/haiku
   workers get only ONE attempt before escalating — counting rule:
   mx-doctrine model-dispatch §6.)

## Gates

mx-flow pauses at **one human gate** (spec approval). All other gates
auto-proceed — reports are still shown for visibility. Gates are review
opportunities, not "y/n continue" prompts.

| Gate | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **GATE 1 — Spec** | **Human.** Show the draft spec; discuss and adjust until the user explicitly confirms. Do not proceed without approval. |
| **GATE 2 — Task list** | Auto. Show the task list for visibility, then proceed immediately. |
| **GATE 3 — Triage** | Auto. Show the triage report, auto-approve all "fix" items, execute immediately. |
| **GATE 4 — PR** | Auto. Draft and publish the PR autonomously; show the draft for visibility. Pause only if the agent cannot determine how to proceed (no remote, ambiguous platform, missing credentials). |

The convergent-loop safety limit (3 iterations, Phase 5) always applies —
its escalation requires human input regardless.

**Orchestrated sub-skills:** the sub-skills this flow invokes contain
their own interactive pauses. This gate table overrides those pauses at
GATE 2/3/4. From their side: mx-team-review, mx-review-triage, and mx-pr
each carry an "Orchestrated mode" section stating the same; mx-commit is
orchestrated by passing `--auto` (no section needed); mx-brainstorm's only
pause is GATE 1, which stays human.

## Doctrine

Shared execution doctrine ships in the sibling `mx-doctrine` skill. Paths
resolve as `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../mx-doctrine/references/<file>` — if a
file is missing (partial install), say so once and use the fallback noted
at each reference site.

- `model-dispatch.md` — model tiers for every sub-agent this flow spawns
  (§4 has a table of mx-flow's dispatch sites); escalation ladder (§6).
- `judgment-rubrics.md` — when done is done (§2), when to stop and ask
  (§3), wrong-direction signals (§4), quality floor (§5).
- `delegation-templates.md` — prompt shapes if you need an ad-hoc
  sub-agent beyond the ones this file specifies.

Fallback when mx-doctrine is absent: dispatch execution sub-agents at the
mid tier (`sonnet`), decisions/reviews at the strongest available; apply
the Non-negotiables above literally.

## Overview

```
Phase 1  Brainstorm  →  Design spec + ADR        (/mx-brainstorm)
           [GATE 1] Spec approval                 ← human (only hard gate)
Phase 2  Plan        →  Ordered task list         (built-in)
Phase 3  Scope       →  Per-task DAG + complexity (built-in, Explore sub-agent)
Phase 4  Worktree    →  Isolated branch + baseline (built-in)

── convergent loop (max 3 iterations) ──────────────
  Phase 5a  TDD (per task) → Commit              (built-in + /mx-commit)
  Phase 5b  Review → Triage                      (/mx-team-review + /mx-review-triage)
  → if fixes: back to TDD
  → if clean: exit loop
────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Phase 6  Verify      →  Tests + plan + content check (built-in)
Phase 7  PR          →  Draft → publish            (/mx-pr)
Phase 8  Finish      →  Clean up branch + worktree (references/finish.md, post-merge)
```

---

## Path resolution

All phases use two base directories. Resolve them once at the start.

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
PROJECT=$(basename "$REPO_ROOT")
```

| Variable | Path | Contains |
|----------|------|----------|
| `GLOBAL_MX` | `~/.mx/<project>/<name>/` | spec.md, adr.md (permanent) |
| `LOCAL_MX` | `<repo-root>/.mx/<name>/` | plan.md, scope.yaml, worktree/, tmp/ (ephemeral) |

- `~/.mx/<project>/ai-learning.md` is also in GLOBAL (project-level, not per-feature)
- Create directories as needed: `mkdir -p` for both GLOBAL_MX and LOCAL_MX
- On Windows: `GLOBAL_MX` = `%USERPROFILE%\.mx\<project>\<name>\`

---

## Phase 0 — Initialize

Before anything else:

1. Derive the feature name from the topic (kebab-case, ≤ 4 words).
   Example: `write-timeout-error-propagation`
2. Resolve GLOBAL_MX and LOCAL_MX per the path resolution section above
3. Create both directories if they do not exist
4. **Check `.gitignore`** — ensure `.mx/` is gitignored:
   ```bash
   if [ ! -f "$REPO_ROOT/.gitignore" ]; then
     echo '.mx/' > "$REPO_ROOT/.gitignore"
   elif ! grep -q '^\.mx/$' "$REPO_ROOT/.gitignore"; then
     echo '.mx/' >> "$REPO_ROOT/.gitignore"
   fi
   ```
   If `.gitignore` was created or modified, commit it:
   ```bash
   git add .gitignore && git commit -m "chore: add .mx/ to .gitignore"
   ```
5. **Read relevant context** — based on the topic, use Glob and Read to
   collect information the brainstorm will need:
   - Files, modules, or packages mentioned explicitly in the topic
   - Related code that is likely in scope (e.g. if topic mentions a
     component, read adjacent files)
   - Any design docs, behaviour specs, or CLAUDE.md files that apply
   - Read broadly enough that the first brainstorm question is grounded in
     actual code
6. Announce clearly:

```
mx-flow started
Feature : <feature-name>
Spec    : ~/.mx/<project>/<name>/spec.md (will be written after GATE 1)
Plan    : .mx/<name>/plan.md
Phase   : 1 — Brainstorm
```

Do this before asking any questions or writing any files.

---

## Phase 1 — Brainstorm

Run /mx-brainstorm with the following context:
- The GLOBAL_MX directory has already been created in Phase 0
- The topic is already provided — begin asking clarifying questions
  immediately, do not ask if the user wants to start

Follow mx-brainstorm's full procedure. It owns the spec and ADR output
(written to GLOBAL_MX).

**GATE 1**: Present the draft spec. Do not proceed until the user
explicitly confirms.

---

## Phase 2 — Plan

Decompose the approved spec into a concrete, ordered task list.

### Planning principles

These bind every task you write in this phase. The TDD loop in Phase 5
executes the plan literally — if the plan over-reaches, the implementation
will too. Lock scope here, not later.

**Simplicity first — minimum code that satisfies the spec.**

- No tasks beyond what the spec requires.
- No abstractions, interfaces, or "flexibility" layers the spec did not
  ask for.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- No speculative configuration, feature flags, or extension points "for
  the future".
- If a single function would do, do not invent a class. If a class would
  do, do not invent a package.

**Surgical changes — touch only what the spec requires.**

- Do not plan to "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting that the
  spec did not call out.
- Do not plan refactors of code that is not broken.
- Match existing style and structure even if a different style would be
  your preference.
- If you notice unrelated dead code or technical debt, mention it once to
  the user — do not silently add a cleanup task.
- Orphans your tasks create (now-unused imports, variables, helpers)
  **must** be cleaned in the same task. Pre-existing dead code is out of
  scope unless the user approves.

The test for every task: it traces directly to a sentence in the spec. If
it does not, drop it or ask the user.

### 2.1 — Read the design spec

Read `GLOBAL_MX/spec.md` in full.
Also read relevant existing code (entry points, interfaces, test files) to
understand the current structure before decomposing.

### 2.2 — Decompose into tasks

Break the spec into the smallest tasks where each task:

- Implements **one behavior** (not a file, not a layer)
- Maps to **one commit type** (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `doc`)
- Has a **concrete expected test**: what to write, what it verifies,
  expected output
- Can be committed independently without breaking the build

**Forbidden content in any task:**
- `TBD` or `TODO`
- "similar to Task N"
- "add error handling" (without specifying what error and how)
- "update tests" (without specifying which behavior)
- Pseudo-code or vague descriptions

Task format:

```markdown
### Task N — <type>: <subject (≤ 50 chars)>

**What**: <one sentence describing the behavior added or changed>
**Test**: <what test to write — file, scenario, expected result>
**Files**: <which files will change>
```

### 2.3 — Order the tasks

Order tasks so that:
1. Infrastructure / scaffolding comes first
2. Each task builds on previous ones without requiring future tasks
3. Tests for a behavior come in the same task as the implementation (not
   before, not after)

### 2.4 — Write the plan

Write `LOCAL_MX/plan.md`:

```markdown
# <name> — Plan

> Design spec: ~/.mx/<project>/<name>/spec.md

## Tasks

- [ ] Task 1 — feat: <subject>
- [ ] Task 2 — test: <subject>
- [ ] Task 3 — fix: <subject>
```

Show the full task breakdown (with Task N details) to the user for review.

**GATE 2**: Show the task list for visibility, then proceed immediately.
Announce: `Task list auto-approved.`

Allow the user to add, remove, reorder, or rewrite tasks if they intervene
before auto-proceed.

---

## Phase 3 — Scope analysis

Read the spec, the plan, and the repo, then produce machine-readable
per-task metadata that downstream phases use to reason about dependencies
and complexity. The output is `.mx/<name>/scope.yaml`. This phase runs
**autonomously via a read-only sub-agent** — no user gate; the parent
prints a one-line summary at the end for visibility.

This metadata drives Phase 5's execution mode: tasks marked
`parallelizable: true` are dispatched to concurrent sub-agents in a batch
(5a-parallel); the rest run sequentially (5a-sequential). Never skip this
phase — without `scope.yaml`, every task falls back to sequential
execution.

### 3.1 — Spawn the scope analyzer sub-agent

Invoke the Agent tool with `subagent_type: Explore`, model mid tier —
read-only repo-scanning is exactly its profile. Brief the sub-agent with:

- Path to `~/.mx/<project>/<name>/spec.md`
- Path to `.mx/<name>/plan.md`
- Repo root (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`)
- The schema spec (section 3.2) and complexity rubric (section 3.3)
- A directive: read-only analysis; return the scope YAML as your final
  message; do not modify code, plan, or spec

The sub-agent must:

1. Read spec.md and plan.md
2. Pre-scan the repo: list likely target directories, grep for similar
   modules / patterns the tasks will extend, identify which existing files
   are obvious candidates
3. For each task in plan.md, infer the schema fields below
4. Compute `parallelizable = (total_tasks >= 3) AND (depends_on == [])
   AND (complexity in {M, L})`
   - The `total_tasks >= 3` gate suppresses parallel dispatch on tiny
     plans, where sub-agent spin-up overhead exceeds the wall-clock
     savings. The parent passes the total task count to the sub-agent as
     part of the brief.
5. Return the complete YAML content plus a short summary (counts of vague
   tasks, parallel batches, sequential tasks) as its final message.
   **The parent then writes `.mx/<name>/scope.yaml` from that returned
   YAML** — Explore sub-agents are read-only and cannot write files.

### 3.2 — Schema

```yaml
- id: task-1                                   # matches plan.md ordering: task-1, task-2, ...
  task: "<verbatim copy of plan.md bullet>"
  predicted_files:                             # repo-relative paths
    - internal/cache/adapter.go
    - internal/cache/adapter_test.go
  predicted_touches:                           # symbols, functions, endpoints
    - RedisClient.Get
    - RedisClient.Set
  depends_on: []                               # ids of tasks that must finish first; [] if independent
  complexity: M                                # S | M | L
  complexity_reason: "two new files, ~80 LOC, follows existing adapter pattern"
  vague: false                                 # true only when sub-agent could not reliably infer
  vague_reason: ""                             # populated only when vague: true
  parallelizable: false                        # derived field; computed by the sub-agent
```

`depends_on` should reflect either **shared files** (two tasks edit the
same file → ordering matters) or **logical preconditions** (task B calls a
symbol introduced by task A). When unsure, add the dependency rather than
omit it.

### 3.3 — Complexity rubric

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **S** | ≤ ~30 LOC, single file, predicted 1 TDD round, no external integration |
| **M** | ~30–150 LOC, 2–3 files, predicted 1–2 TDD rounds, may touch one integration boundary |
| **L** | > 150 LOC, multi-module, ≥ 2 TDD rounds expected, or non-trivial external integration (DB / network / filesystem / external API) |

When signals are ambiguous, bias toward **higher** complexity and **more**
dependencies. Over-estimating costs nothing (parent falls back to
sequential); under-estimating creates merge collisions later.

### 3.4 — Refinement loop (max 2 rounds)

After the sub-agent returns, the parent reads `scope.yaml` and inspects
for `vague: true` entries.

**Round 1 → Round 2.** If any task has `vague: true`, the parent rewrites
those specific bullets in `plan.md` using the sub-agent's `vague_reason`
as guidance — name the file(s), the function/endpoint, the interface
contract. Then re-invoke the sub-agent. Tasks that were not vague stay
untouched.

**After Round 2.** Whatever the sub-agent returns is final. Any task still
marked `vague: true` keeps its conservative defaults (`complexity: L`,
`parallelizable: false`) and proceeds. Bouncing further has diminishing
returns — the task is one that requires hands-on discovery during TDD.

Cap is **2 rounds**. Never loop indefinitely.

### 3.5 — Fallback on failure

If the sub-agent fails (timeout, crash, invalid or missing YAML in its
reply), the parent writes a minimal `scope.yaml` directly:

```yaml
- id: task-N
  task: "<copy from plan.md>"
  predicted_files: []
  predicted_touches: []
  depends_on: []
  complexity: L
  complexity_reason: "scope analyzer failed; conservative default applied"
  vague: true
  vague_reason: "scope analyzer failed; safe fallback applied"
  parallelizable: false
```

Every task gets the same shape. Downstream phases see zero parallelizable
tasks and run fully sequential. The flow does not block.

### 3.6 — Summary

Print one line to the user for visibility (not a gate):

```
Scope analysis: <N> tasks → <K> parallel batches (B1: T1+T3, B2: T4), <S> sequential (T2, T5).
```

If everything sequential:

```
Scope analysis: <N> tasks, all sequential (no independent batches identified).
```

If the fallback fired:

```
Scope analysis: failed → conservative defaults applied, all tasks sequential.
```

Then auto-proceed to Phase 4.

---

## Phase 4 — Worktree

Create an isolated git worktree for the feature branch.

### 4.1 — Determine branch name

Apply branch naming convention:

| Change type | Prefix |
|---|---|
| New feature | `feat/<name>` |
| Bug fix | `bugfix/<name>` |
| Quick fix (config, docs, CI) | `fix/<name>` |
| Maintenance, deps, tooling | `chore/<name>` |

If the user provided a name without a prefix, ask which prefix applies.
If the name already has a correct prefix, proceed.

### 4.2 — Create the worktree

First, resolve the base branch in this order:

1. Check if `develop` exists (local or remote):
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --verify develop 2>/dev/null || git rev-parse --verify origin/develop 2>/dev/null
   ```
2. If found → use `develop` as base
3. Otherwise, check if `main` exists:
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --verify main 2>/dev/null || git rev-parse --verify origin/main 2>/dev/null
   ```
4. If found → use `main` as base
5. If neither exists → ask the user which branch to base from

Then create the worktree under LOCAL_MX:

```bash
git worktree add .mx/<name>/worktree -b <branch-name> <base-branch>
```

Verify it was created:

```bash
git worktree list
```

### 4.3 — Run project setup

From within the worktree directory, auto-detect and run setup:

```bash
cd .mx/<name>/worktree

# Go
if [ -f go.mod ]; then go mod download; fi

# Node.js
if [ -f package.json ]; then
  if [ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]; then pnpm install
  elif [ -f yarn.lock ]; then yarn install
  else npm install; fi
fi

# Python
if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
if [ -f pyproject.toml ]; then poetry install; fi

# Rust
if [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then cargo build; fi
```

### 4.4 — Verify baseline

Run the full test suite to confirm the worktree starts clean.

Auto-detect the runner in this priority order (this is the canonical
runner-detection rule — Phases 5 and 6 reuse it):

1. `Makefile` with a `check` or `test` target → `make check` or `make test`
2. `package.json` with a `test` script → `npm test` / `yarn test` / `pnpm test`
3. Language detection: `.go` → `go test ./...`, `.rs` → `cargo test`,
   `.py` → `pytest`, `.cs` → `dotnet test`, `.swift` → `swift test`

**If baseline fails:**
Report the failures and ask the user whether to proceed or investigate
first. Do not proceed silently with a failing baseline.

### 4.5 — Report

```
Worktree ready at .mx/<name>/worktree/
Branch  : <branch-name>
Baseline: <N> tests passing
```

---

## Phase 5 — Convergent loop

### 5a — Task execution (mode selection)

Read `.mx/<name>/scope.yaml`. Partition the still-`[ ]` tasks in `plan.md`:

1. **Ready-set**: tasks whose `depends_on` are all marked `[x]`.
2. **Parallel batch**: ready-set ∩ `parallelizable: true`. If this batch
   has **≥ 2** tasks, dispatch it via **5a-parallel**: read
   `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/parallel-dispatch.md` and follow it in
   full (if that file is missing, fold everything into the sequential
   queue instead). If the batch has 0 or 1 tasks, fold the lone task (if
   any) into the sequential queue — a one-task batch has no parallelism to
   exploit.
3. **Sequential queue**: everything else in the ready-set, processed one
   at a time via **5a-sequential**.

When both a parallel batch and a sequential queue exist, drain the
**parallel batch first** so independent work overlaps with subsequent
batches' planning. After each batch (parallel or sequential), recompute
the ready-set — completing tasks unblocks new ones.

The **Iron Law** and the **vertical-slice TDD philosophy** apply in both
modes. Parallel mode parallelizes *across* tasks, never *within* a task's
RED→GREEN→REFACTOR cycle.

If `scope.yaml` is missing or every task is marked `parallelizable: false`
(fallback path from Phase 3.5), skip 5a-parallel entirely — drive every
task through 5a-sequential.

---

### 5a-sequential — Sequential TDD cycle (per task)

The single-threaded TDD loop. Use it for every task in the sequential
queue, plus all tasks bounced from a failed parallel batch.

#### Philosophy: Vertical Slices Only

```
WRONG (horizontal slicing):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3   ← never do this

RIGHT (vertical slices):
  RED → GREEN: test1 → impl1
  RED → GREEN: test2 → impl2
  RED → GREEN: test3 → impl3
```

Writing tests in bulk produces tests that verify imagined behavior, not
actual behavior. Each test must respond to what you learned from the
previous cycle.

#### For each `[ ]` task in the plan:

**Read the task** — Read `LOCAL_MX/plan.md` and identify the next `[ ]`
task. Read its full specification (What, Test, Files). Read the relevant
existing code before writing anything.

**Tracer bullet (first task only)** — For the first task of a new feature,
write one minimal test that proves the end-to-end path works — even if it
only touches a stub. This confirms the test infrastructure is wired
correctly before building out.

**Red: write the failing test** — Write the test as specified in the task.

Test quality rules:
- Tests verify **behavior through public interfaces**, not implementation
  details
- A good test reads like a specification: "user can do X given Y"
- The test must **fail** before any production code is written
- Run the test and **observe the failure** — if it passes immediately, the
  test is wrong

Run it with the runner from Phase 4.4. Confirm the test fails with the
expected error (missing symbol, assertion failure, etc.). A test that
passes without implementation proves nothing.

**Green: minimal implementation** — Write the **simplest code** that makes
the test pass.

Rules:
- Only enough code to pass the current test
- Do not anticipate future tests
- Do not add features not required by the current test
- Speculative code is forbidden

**Comment policy (enforced while writing, not only at review)** —
Canonical source:
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../mx-team-review/references/principles.md` →
*P2 — Comment (Why)*. Essentials:

- **Default: no comment.** Add one only when WHY is non-obvious to a
  future reader.
- **Forbidden:** comments that restate WHAT the code does, empty doc
  summaries (`/// Creates an order.`), vague pronouns (`this`,
  `the above`, `as mentioned`).
- **Required for:** magic numbers, framework-default overrides,
  business-rule enforcement, external workarounds (link the issue),
  TODO/FIXME (link or explain why and when).
- **Style:** lead with WHY, name the concrete subject + triggering
  scenario, hard limit **3 lines**. If it needs more, the code probably
  needs to change instead.

If you find yourself writing a "WHAT" comment, delete it and improve the
identifier name instead.

Run the test again — confirm it passes.
Run the full suite — confirm nothing else broke.

**If GREEN won't come** — the same task failing twice triggers
Non-negotiable 5 (retry budget). Weakening the test to pass is
Non-negotiable 3. There is no third identical attempt.

**Refactor** — Only after GREEN, look for improvements:

- Extract duplication
- Improve naming
- Simplify logic
- Apply existing patterns from the codebase

Rules:
- **Never refactor while RED**
- Run tests after each refactor step — if anything breaks, revert
  immediately
- Refactor is optional; skip if the code is already clean

**Exit condition checklist** — Before marking the task done, verify all
six conditions:

```
□ RED observed: test failure was seen with actual output (not assumed)
□ GREEN confirmed: test passes after implementation
□ Full suite clean: no new failures introduced by this change
□ Comment policy: no WHAT-comments, no vague pronouns, magic numbers/workarounds explain WHY, every comment ≤3 lines
□ Plan updated: task marked [x] in .mx/<name>/plan.md
□ Committed: /mx-commit --auto completed for this task
```

If any item is unchecked, do not advance to the next task.

After each task completes, return to **5a (Task execution)** to recompute
the ready-set — a finished task may have unblocked a parallel batch. Exit
the loop when all tasks are done or a milestone is reached.

### 5b — Review (at milestone)

Run /mx-team-review on the diff since the branch was created, using the
base branch resolved in Phase 4.2:
```bash
git diff $(git merge-base HEAD <base-branch>)..HEAD
```

Run /mx-review-triage with `--source review` directly (no auto-detect).

**GATE 3**: Show the triage summary, auto-approve all "fix" items, execute
immediately (commits go through `/mx-commit --auto`). "Track" items are
still written to TODOS.md and "Skip" items noted in the report — both
without pausing. Announce: `Triage auto-approved — executing <N> fixes.`

After fixes are applied:
- If fixes were made → run the test suite → back to 5a for any new tasks,
  increment iteration counter
- If clean (no fixes needed) → exit the loop

### Loop safety limit

The convergent loop has a maximum of **3 iterations** (one iteration = one
full tdd → review → triage cycle).

If the loop reaches 3 iterations without converging to clean:

```
[ESCALATE] Convergent loop has not resolved after 3 iterations.

Current state:
  Iteration: 3/3
  Remaining findings: <list>

Options:
  [A] Continue — extend the loop (you take responsibility)
  [B] Redesign — the findings suggest a design issue; revisit ~/.mx/<project>/<name>/spec.md (design spec)
  [C] Abort — discard this branch and start fresh

Three iterations without convergence usually indicates a design problem,
not a code problem.
```

Do not continue automatically. Wait for the user to choose.

---

## Phase 6 — Verify and commit

Final verification gate. No partial checks accepted.

### 6.1 — Run full test suite

Run the complete test suite with the runner from Phase 4.4. No partial
runs.

Read the full output. Count failures.

**If any test fails:** report the failures with output, stop. Do not
proceed.
**If all pass:** state the count explicitly: `N tests passing, 0 failures`.

### 6.2 — Check plan completion

Read `LOCAL_MX/plan.md`.

For every task line, verify its status:
- `[x]` — completed
- `[ ]` — pending

If any task is still `[ ]`, list them and stop. Do not claim completion
with open tasks.
If all tasks are `[x]`, report: `All N tasks complete.`

### 6.3 — Remind ai-learning

Show this reminder:

```
Update ~/.mx/<project>/ai-learning.md before closing this session.

Format:
| Date       | Issue or Learning | Root Cause | Prevention Rule |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | <what happened>   | <why>      | <how to avoid>  |

Record at least one entry — even if no mistakes were made.
Acceptable entries: techniques confirmed, observations, rules verified.
```

### 6.4 — Gate result

Only if 6.1 and 6.2 both pass:

```
Verification passed.
  Tests: N passing, 0 failures
  Plan:  N/N tasks complete

Ready to commit and push.
```

If verification passes, run /mx-commit --auto for any remaining staged
changes.

### 6.5 — Content check (autonomous cleanup)

Clean the branch history before the PR phase: two autonomous passes —
**Pass 1** removes net-zero churn (commits/hunks that cancel each other on
the branch), **Pass 2** folds small fixups into their logical parent. Each
pass is guarded by a tree-hash invariant and reverts itself on any
mismatch. No user prompt.

**Execute the canonical procedure**: read and follow
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../mx-pr/references/content-check.md`, with
`<base-branch>` = the base branch resolved in Phase 4.2 (if that value is
no longer in context, re-derive it with the same develop-then-main rule).
If the content-check file is missing, announce `Content-check reference
missing — skipping here; Phase 7 will run mx-pr's own copy if mx-pr is
installed` and proceed to Phase 7 **without** rewriting any history.

Phase 6 ends here. Proceed to Phase 7.

### Abort path

When verification fails, present three recovery options:

```
[VERIFICATION FAILED]
  <specific failure: test output / open tasks>

Recovery options:
  [A] Investigate — return to Phase 5a to fix the failing test or task
        Re-entry: specify which task or failing test to address first
  [B] Adjust plan — the failure reveals that a task definition was wrong
        Re-entry: edit .mx/<name>/plan.md, then re-run Phase 5a for that task
  [C] Abort branch — this branch is not recoverable
        Will preserve: ~/.mx/<project>/<name>/spec.md and adr.md (design spec)
        Will discard:  .mx/<name>/plan.md
        Reminder:      git worktree remove .mx/<name>/worktree
```

Wait for the user to choose. Do not attempt to fix anything automatically.

---

## Phase 7 — PR

Run /mx-pr (if the mx-pr skill is not installed, tell the user the flow
ends here and hand them the branch name and base branch — do not improvise
a PR). It will:
- Run the content check again (no-op if Phase 6.5 already cleaned)
- Draft the PR description from the spec and git log
- Publish or hand off

**GATE 4** applies: auto-proceed — draft the PR and publish directly. Show
the draft for visibility but do not wait for confirmation (mx-pr's
"Orchestrated mode" section defers to this gate). Only pause and ask the
user if:
- No git remote is configured
- Multiple remotes exist and the target is ambiguous
- Platform credentials are missing or authentication fails
- Any other situation where the agent cannot determine the correct action

Announce: `PR auto-published.`

After /mx-pr completes (published or skipped), announce:

```
mx-flow complete.
After merge: /mx-flow finish <name>
```

---

## Phase 8 — Finish (post-merge cleanup)

Triggered by `/mx-flow finish <name>`, independently from the main
pipeline. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/finish.md` and follow it in
full.

Summary of what it does: confirm the PR is merged → delete `plan.md` and
`scope.yaml` → preserve the spec and ADR under `~/.mx/<project>/<name>/` →
clean `.mx/<name>/tmp/` (user picks) → `git worktree remove` (never
`--force` automatically) → `git branch -d` (never `-D` automatically) →
summary. If the reference file is missing, follow this summary literally
and stop at any git refusal to ask the user.
